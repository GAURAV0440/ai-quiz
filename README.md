# Overview
This project helps students improve their exam performance by analyzing their quiz history and current performance. It provides personalized recommendations on what topics to focus on, tracks progress over time, and even assigns learning personas based on individual strengths and weaknesses.

# How It Works
We analyze two types of quiz data:

1️⃣ Current Quiz Data – The most recent quiz attempt, including topics, responses, and scores.
2️⃣ Historical Quiz Data – Past quiz performance (last five attempts), tracking accuracy trends and weak areas.
Based on this, we identify patterns, track progress, and generate personalized study strategies.
